# Pedometer App

The **Pedometer App** is a mobile application designed to track the user's steps and calculate the distance traveled, calories burned, and other fitness-related metrics. It uses the device's built-in accelerometer sensor to detect movement and provide real-time feedback.

## About the Project

The **Pedometer App** was created to:
- Help users monitor their daily physical activity.
- Showcase the integration of sensor-based tracking in Android development.
- Provide an easy-to-use interface for tracking fitness goals.

## Features
- **Step Tracking**:
  - Counts steps accurately using the deviceâ€™s accelerometer.
- **Distance Calculation**:
  - Calculates the distance traveled based on the number of steps.
- **Calorie Tracker**:
  - Estimates calories burned during physical activity.
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Simple and clean design for seamless user interaction.
- **Real-Time Updates**:
  - Updates step count and metrics dynamically as the user moves.


## Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **Android Studio**
- **XML** for layout design
- **Accelerometer Sensor API**

## How to Run the App
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raf1dhasan/Pedometer.git
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync the Gradle files to download dependencies.
4. Build and run the app on an emulator or a connected Android device.

## What I Did
- Integrated the accelerometer sensor to count steps and detect movement.
- Developed algorithms to calculate distance and calories burned.
- Designed the user interface with XML for a clean and responsive experience.

## What I Learned
Improved knowledge of:
- Sensor integration in Android (accelerometer).
- Developing real-time data processing for fitness tracking apps.
- Optimizing apps for battery efficiency when using sensors.
- Gained hands-on experience with debugging and testing sensor-based Android applications.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for user-defined stride length and weight for more accurate calculations.
- Implement a history feature to log daily, weekly, and monthly activity stats.
- Add a dark mode for improved usability in low-light conditions.
- Include notifications for goal achievement and inactivity reminders.
